Regenerate CNFs for each test! Otherwise this is testing nothing.

Alternative: use the difference triangle. Introduce variables from -N..N
on each level of the triangle (checking only half of them is sufficient
according to a theorem) which represent the possible outcomes of
subtractions of the images under the permutation; the level determines
the distance of the inverse images. For each level, each number can only
occur at most once as a difference.

The current implementation uses O(N^2) variables and O(N^2+N^6) clauses.
The difference triangle would introduce O(N^3) variables and O(N^4)
clauses (each of these O's swallows lower-degree terms which might not
be insignificant!).

If we want to target specifically N=32, we can exploit the fact that it
is a power of 2 and use a compact variable encoding. We have to implement
arithmetic in the SAT solver then and would basically do the difference
triangle method.
